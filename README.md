# godot-duckdb

This GDNative script aims to serve as a custom wrapper that makes DuckDB available in Godot 4.0+.
It is heavily inspired by the [godot-sqlite](https://github.com/2shady4u/godot-sqlite) wrapper. **Alot** of the code base (even this README.md!) from the godot-sqlite repository has been used in this project.

This is the orphaned 'assetlib'-branch that serves as a disconnected branch from which the Godot Asset Library downloads its files.
